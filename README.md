# Deep_Learning_for_Bacteria_Identification_using_Raman_Spectroscopy

Bacterial infections are a leading cause of death in almost every nation, causing more than 6.7 million deaths every year [3][4]. In the United States alone, these infections require $33 billion for annual healthcare spending, equivalent to 8.7% of the total healthcare expenditure [5], and hence are particularly costly.

To detect and identify the bacteria and its antibiotic resistance, current diagnos- tic methods include sample culture. However, this is a slow process, that can take days even in state-of-the-art laboratories [6][7]. New methods for rapid culture-free diagnosis of bacterial infections are therefore required. Raman spectroscopy has the potential to identify the species of bacteria and, consequently, its antibiotic suscep- tibility. Molecular compositions describe different bacterial phenotypes, leading to subtle variations in their corresponding Raman spectra.

In this project, we initially conceive a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify bacterial spectra and the related antibiotic treatment, measuring the isolate- level accuracies and comparing it with a state-of-the-art CNN. Secondly, we compare two popular machine learning algorithms against our CNN model, in order to evaluate if a deep approach could lead to better performance.
